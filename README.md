# Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD)

**Official implementation of "Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion" (ICML 2025)**  

> ðŸ”¬ This repository contains the code for PT simulation, PT+DM training, and PTSD training.

ðŸš§ **Coming Soon!** Full documentation will be released shortly.

---

## Installation

Create the conda environment and install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running Experiments

We provide an example on the GMM task. This includes three main stages:

### 1. Simulate PT

Run parallel tempering to generate initial samples, saved to `data/pt/pt_gmm.pt`:

```bash
python main.py --config-name=pt_gmm
```

### 2. Train PT+DM

Train a diffusion model using the PT samples:

```bash
python main.py --config-name=gmm prefix="ptdm"
```

### 3. Train PTSD
Train the full PTSD framework using both PT and DM:

```bash
python main.py --config-name=gmm
```
